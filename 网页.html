            <time>2018/2/1</time>
            <p>On a serendipitous winter day, in the labyrinthine corridors of the campus, their eyes met like stars aligning in the cosmic expanse. A gentle jolt, a flutter of hearts, and destiny whispered its first sweet promise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2018/5/10</time>
            <p>In the quiet sanctuary of the classroom, where knowledge danced on the air, he became her guiding light. With words as gentle as a summer breeze, he untangled the knots of her confusion, and a seed of admiration bloomed in her heart.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2018/9/20</time>
            <p>Under the golden canopy of autumn, at the school sports meet, he was a blazing comet on the track. She stood on the sidelines, her cheers a symphony of support, and in that moment, their souls soared together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2018/11/5</time>
            <p>In the hushed embrace of the library, among the whispering shelves of books, they found themselves side by side. Their shared silence was a poem, and the air between them was charged with the electricity of unspoken feelings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2019/1/15</time>
            <p>With a courage born of a budding affection, he reached out and asked for her contact. And so, their digital conversations became a tapestry of shared dreams, laughter, and the soft cadence of growing closeness.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2019/3/22</time>
            <p>On a lazy weekend, by the tranquil lake in the park, they strolled hand in hand. The world around them faded into a blur as they lost themselves in the magic of each other's presence, their hearts beating in sync.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2019/6/8</time>
            <p>On a warm summer night, beneath the velvet blanket of the sky, they lay side by side, gazing at the stars. His voice, like a gentle lullaby, wove tales of constellations, and she fell deeper under his spell.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2019/8/12</time>
            <p>When illness cast a shadow over her world, he was her knight in shining armor. With a tender touch and a heart full of love, he brought her medicine and warmth, and in that moment, she knew she was cherished.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2019/10/18</time>
            <p>In the dimly lit movie theater, surrounded by the soft murmur of the film, his hand found hers. A spark ignited, and in that simple gesture, they crossed the threshold into a world of shared intimacy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2019/12/25</time>
            <p>On her birthday, he transformed a simple room into a wonderland of love. The twinkling lights, the sweet aroma of flowers, and his heartfelt words were a symphony of romance, and she was lost in a sea of bliss.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2020/3/3</time>
            <p>On the peak of a mountain, where the wind carried the echoes of the earth, they stood hand in hand. With the world at their feet, they shouted their love into the void, and the mountains echoed their passion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2020/5/21</time>
            <p>A storm of words had passed between them, but love prevailed. With a humble apology and a heart full of remorse, he mended the cracks in their relationship, and their bond grew stronger than ever.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2020/11/11</time>
            <p>In the cold embrace of winter, he wrapped a hand - knitted scarf around her neck. The warmth of the wool was nothing compared to the warmth of his love, and she felt safe in his arms.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2021/2/14</time>
            <p>At a friend's party, amidst the laughter and the music, he looked into her eyes and bared his soul. With a voice trembling with emotion, he confessed his love, and she said yes, sealing their fate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2021/4/16</time>
            <p>As lovers, they embarked on a journey to distant lands. Each new landscape was a chapter in their love story, and with every step, they created memories that would last a lifetime.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2021/6/20</time>
            <p>On Valentine's Day, he presented her with a bouquet of red roses and a diamond ring. The flowers were a symbol of his passion, and the ring was a promise of forever. She looked into his eyes and knew she was home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="timeline-item">
            <time>2021/8/28</time>
            <p>When the weight of the world bore down on her at work, he was her rock. With a shoulder to cry on and words of encouragement, he helped her rise above the storm, and their love became a beacon of hope.</p>
